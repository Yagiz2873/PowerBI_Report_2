# PowerBI_Report_2
In this file, I've added photos of my PowerBI Report for a dataset. I haven't added my whole PowerBI report because I can't add the dataset for its privacy rules. As you can see from the photos, I've used different kinds of graphics and charts such as gauge, line chart, treemap etc. Also for every page, I've added a navigation structure from the PowerBI that can tell you which page you're on the report. Besides in my report I've added a button on the ever black flower icon so the report can direct you to the Miuul's webpage. 

The total monetary icon belongs to the nangicon,
